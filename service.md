In addition to my principal activity of research and to teaching, I am keen to
assist the advancement of the discipline and the profession as a whole, and in
its service to society.

## Scientific community service

This year I will be part of the LFMTP'21 program committee.

## Professional associations

I am one of the founding members and part of the governing board of
[CPIIAR](https://cpiiaragon.es/), one of the regional statutory corporations
that oversee the development of computer engineering as a profession in Spain.

Related to this initiative, I am also part of a working group within
[CCII](https://ccii.es/), the national council of which CPIIAR is part.
