I am a member of the [Parsifal](https://team.inria.fr/parsifal/) team
at [Inria Saclay - Île de France](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/saclay).
I work under the supervision of [Dale Miller](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Dale.Miller/)
in the themes of the ERC Advanced Grant [ProofCert](https://team.inria.fr/parsifal/proofcert/).
I am also part of the [Laboratoire d'Informatique](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/)
at the [École polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), where I am a doctoral student and teach
under the umbrella of the [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/).

My research and technical interests revolve around various interrelated topics:

* Proof theory and sequent calculi, proof assistants
* Proofs and certification, formal specification and verification
* Functional and logic programming, type systems

The grand unifying theme, and pragmatic motivation, is an ambition that I am
convinced is both lofty and conquerable: this is the need for trust and
correctness — in theorems as in the entire pantheon of formalizable artifacts,
with software as *primus inter pares* in today's world — and a discipline that
treats these as first-class abstractions.
