I am a member of the [Prosecco](http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/) team
at [Inria Paris](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/paris).
I work with [Cătălin Hriţcu](http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/)
in the themes of the ERC [SECOMP](https://secure-compilation.github.io/) project.

During my doctoral studies,
I was a member of the [Parsifal](https://team.inria.fr/parsifal/) team
at [Inria Saclay - Île de France](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/saclay).
I was advised by [Dale Miller](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Dale.Miller/)
working in the ERC Advanced Grant [ProofCert](https://team.inria.fr/parsifal/proofcert/).

My research and technical interests revolve around various interrelated topics:

 * Formal specification and verification, proof assistants
 * Functional and logic programming, type systems
 * Proof theory and sequent calculi, proofs and certificates

The grand unifying theme, and pragmatic motivation, is an ambition that I am
convinced is both lofty and realistic: this is the need for trust and
correctness — in theorems as in the entire pantheon of formalizable artifacts,
with software as *primus inter pares* in today's world — and a discipline that
treats these as first-class abstractions.
