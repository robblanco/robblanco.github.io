Currently, I am a Starting Researcher
in the [Prosecco](http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/) team
at [Inria Paris](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/paris).
I work with [Cătălin Hriţcu](http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/)
in the ERC [SECOMP](https://secure-compilation.github.io/) project
and the DARPA [SSITH](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2017-04-10) HOPE project.

My research interests are centered around the development and application of
formal methods to solve computer security problems, developed along both axes:

 * Programming languages: proof assistants; formal specification, testing and
   verification; proof certificates; type systems; computational logic.

 * Computer security: secure compilation; compartmentalization; security
   policies; secure hardware.

The principal objective of my work at Prosecco is to build secure compilation
chains that preserve useful classes of security properties while scaling to
realistic programming languages and enabling efficient and secure program
execution.

Previously, I was a doctoral researcher
in the [Parsifal](https://team.inria.fr/parsifal/) team
(now [Partout](https://team.inria.fr/partout/))
at the [LIX laboratory](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/) at
[École polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/)
and [Inria Saclay - Île de France](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/saclay).
I was advised by [Dale Miller](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Dale.Miller/)
working in the ERC [ProofCert](https://team.inria.fr/parsifal/proofcert/) project.

A grand unifying theme and pragmatic motivation of my research is an ambition
that I am convinced is both lofty and realistic: this is the need for trust
(which encompasses a notion of security) and correctness — in theorems as in
the entire pantheon of formalizable artifacts, with software as *primus inter
pares* in today's world — and a discipline that treats these as first-class
abstractions.
