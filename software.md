A substantial part of my time is devoted to designing and writing software, in
particular software that proves things about other formal artifacts: programs,
logical formulas, mathematical theorems, etc. This comprises work on a bestiary
of systems that includes proof checkers, interactive theorem provers, and
increasingly compilers and interpreters. Parts of this work are published as
free and open source software, while other, more experimental and embryonic
branches patiently bid their time.
