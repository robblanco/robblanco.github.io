A substantial part of my time is devoted to designing and writing software, in
particular software that proves things about other formal artifacts: programs,
formulas of logic, mathematical theorems, etc. This comprises work on a bestiary
of systems that includes proof checkers, interactive theorem provers, and
increasingly compilers and interpreters. Some of this work is publicly
available as free and open source software, while more experimental and
embryonic branches patiently bid their time.

* Recently, I am giving plentiful thought to the proof assistant
  [Abella](http://abella-prover.org/): both in relatively self-contained but
  useful features and technical improvements; and in large, ongoing
  modifications to the kernel of the system.

* Many smaller projects are directly related to the declared goal of ProofCert
  of universal production, communication (i.e., reuse) and checking (i.e.,
  trust) of proof evidence. Families of proof checkers (minimalistic or not,
  correct by construction or certified), as well as foundational proof
  certificate formats, belong here.

* Last year, I commenced work on a gradually typed flavor of the Ruby
  programming language, similar in spirit to recent developments for other
  dynamic languages like TypeScript --- though incubating my dissertation
  presently keeps me from revisiting it. The original proposal was supported by
  Google Summer of Code 2016.
