I teach laboratory classes in the computer science track of the engineering
cycle at Ã‰cole polytechnique in double weekly two-hour sessions.

This year's classes (2016-2017):

* [Concurrent and distributed programming (INF431)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF431-2016)
* [Parallel programming and big data (INF442)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF442-2016).
  For this class I have prepared a student project to analyze real-time data
  from the public transportation system of the Paris metropolitan area.

Last year's classes (2015-2016):

* [Concurrent and distributed programming (INF431)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF431-2015)
* [Programming language principles (INF321)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF321-2015).
  Here I revamped one of the five two-week projects to serve as an introduction
  to unit testing and test-driven development.
