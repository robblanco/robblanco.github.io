I love teaching. It is an intellectually stimulating and deeply rewarding
activity of which I wish to do more, especially along two axes: teaching full
courses, both theory and practice; and illuminating the subject matter through
the lens of my research interests, as I believe they have a crucial role to
play in our understanding of computing.

I am also very interested in making important concepts more widely accessible,
in particular to students and professionals.

This page lists some courses I have been fortunate to teach or plan to teach in
the near future, as well as related activities.

### 2019-2020

* Software engineering (CS3053)

I am planning to teach a series of short courses in Spain tailored to introduce
both students (advanced undergrads and up) and professionals to the practical
use of formal methods, still greatly understudied vis-à-vis other countries.

* Introduction to verified programming.
  Upcoming course based on Software Foundations.

* Advanced functional programming.
  Another course in preparation.

### 2018-2019

* [Writing and verifying functional programs in Coq](https://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/teaching/lyon2019/)
  I taught the practical sessions for one of the groups of the
  [Mathinfoly](http://www.mathinfoly.org/) summer school at INSA in Lyon, and
  cosupervised all other student activities.

### 2017-2018

During this and the previous two school years I taught laboratory classes in the
computer science track of the engineering cycle at École polytechnique,
typically in weekly two-hour sessions for two separate groups.

* [Computational logic (INF551)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF551-2017)
  Artificial intelligence in mathematical reasoning.

### 2016-2017

* [Concurrent and distributed programming (INF431)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF431-2016)
* [Parallel programming and big data (INF442)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF442-2016).
  For this class I also proposed and supervised student projects to analyze
  real-time data from the public transportation system of the Paris metropolitan
  area.

### 2015-2016

* [Concurrent and distributed programming (INF431)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF431-2015)
* [Programming language principles (INF321)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF321-2015).
  Here I revamped one of the five two-week projects to serve as an introduction
  to unit testing and test-driven development.

### Before

Between 2012 and 2014 I was in charge of various in-house training courses
offered to junior engineers and testers covering a variety of topics, including
software stacks, development processes, problem domains, systems architecture
and business functions.
