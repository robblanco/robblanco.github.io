I love teaching. It is deeply rewarding both personally and intellectually, and
a necessary extension of personal study and research.

I am interested in organizing and teaching innovative courses as head
instructor, as well as in collaborating with others to teach such courses at
various levels.

In particular, I am very keen to make novel and important developments
accessible and useful to students and professionals alike, especially in my
areas of expertise; as well to mentor people interested in these areas.

This page lists some courses that I have been fortunate to teach and plan to
teach in the near future, as well as related activities.

## 2020-2021

I am planning to teach a series of short courses tailored to introduce both
students (advanced undergrads and up) and professionals to the practical use of
formal methods in Spain, where these topics are still greatly understudied
vis-à-vis other countries. (These are currently on hold due to the ongoing
coronavirus pandemic).

* Introduction to verified programming.
  An abridgment of the verification and security course with a focus on the
  former.

* Advanced functional programming.
  Another course in preparation.

### 2019-2020

* [Software engineering (CS3053)](https://catalog.aup.edu/course/cs3053/spring-2020).
  I was a lecturer at the American University of Paris, teaching a
  full course based on the excellent *Engineering Software as a Service*. The
  second half of this class, including the group projects in which students
  built web applications applying modern technologies methodologies, was carried
  out remotely in a geographically distributed clasroom and teams of students.

* [Software foundations: introduction to verified programming](/teaching/unizar2020/).
  Upcoming course to be taught as part of the interdisciplinary summer school of
  the University of Zaragoza, based on *Software foundations*.

### 2018-2019

* [Writing and verifying functional programs in Coq](https://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/teaching/lyon2019/)
  I taught the practical sessions for one of the groups of the
  [Mathinfoly](http://www.mathinfoly.org/) summer school at INSA in Lyon, and
  cosupervised all other student activities.

### 2017-2018

During this and the previous two school years I taught laboratory classes in the
computer science track of the engineering cycle at École polytechnique,
typically in weekly two-hour sessions for two separate groups.

* [Computational logic (INF551)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF551-2017)
  Artificial intelligence in mathematical reasoning.

### 2016-2017

* [Concurrent and distributed programming (INF431)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF431-2016)
* [Parallel programming and big data (INF442)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF442-2016).
  For this class I also proposed and supervised student projects to analyze
  real-time data from the public transportation system of the Paris metropolitan
  area.

### 2015-2016

* [Concurrent and distributed programming (INF431)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF431-2015)
* [Programming language principles (INF321)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF321-2015).
  Here I revamped one of the five two-week projects to serve as an introduction
  to unit testing and test-driven development.

### Before

Between 2012 and 2014 I was in charge of various in-house training courses
offered to junior engineers and testers covering a variety of topics, including
software stacks, development processes, problem domains, systems architecture
and business functions.
