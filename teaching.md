I love teaching. It is deeply rewarding both personally and intellectually, and
a necessary extension of personal study and research.

I am interested in organizing and teaching innovative courses as head
instructor, as well as in collaborating with others to teach such courses at
various levels.

In particular, I am very keen to make novel and important developments
accessible and useful to students and professionals alike, especially in my
areas of expertise; as well to mentor people interested in these areas.

This page lists some courses that I have been fortunate to teach and plan to
teach in the near future, as well as related activities.

### 2019-2020

* [Software engineering (CS3053)](https://catalog.aup.edu/course/cs3053/spring-2020).
  I am currently a lecturer at the American University of Paris, teaching a full
  course based on the excellent *Engineering Software as a Service*.

* [Software foundations: introduction to verified programming](/unizar2020/).
  Upcoming course to be taught as part of the interdisciplinary summer school of
  the University of Zaragoza.

I am planning to teach a series of short courses in Spain tailored to introduce
both students (advanced undergrads and up) and professionals to the practical
use of formal methods, still greatly understudied vis-à-vis other countries.

* Introduction to verified programming.
  Upcoming course based on Software Foundations.

* Advanced functional programming.
  Another course in preparation.

### 2018-2019

* [Writing and verifying functional programs in Coq](https://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/teaching/lyon2019/)
  I taught the practical sessions for one of the groups of the
  [Mathinfoly](http://www.mathinfoly.org/) summer school at INSA in Lyon, and
  cosupervised all other student activities.

### 2017-2018

During this and the previous two school years I taught laboratory classes in the
computer science track of the engineering cycle at École polytechnique,
typically in weekly two-hour sessions for two separate groups.

* [Computational logic (INF551)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF551-2017)
  Artificial intelligence in mathematical reasoning.

### 2016-2017

* [Concurrent and distributed programming (INF431)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF431-2016)
* [Parallel programming and big data (INF442)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF442-2016).
  For this class I also proposed and supervised student projects to analyze
  real-time data from the public transportation system of the Paris metropolitan
  area.

### 2015-2016

* [Concurrent and distributed programming (INF431)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF431-2015)
* [Programming language principles (INF321)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF321-2015).
  Here I revamped one of the five two-week projects to serve as an introduction
  to unit testing and test-driven development.

### Before

Between 2012 and 2014 I was in charge of various in-house training courses
offered to junior engineers and testers covering a variety of topics, including
software stacks, development processes, problem domains, systems architecture
and business functions.
