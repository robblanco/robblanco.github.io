### 2019-2020

* Introduction to verified programming.

### 2018-2019

* [Writing and verifying functional programs in Coq](https://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/teaching/lyon2019/)
  I taught the practical sessions for one of the groups of the
  [Mathinfoly](http://www.mathinfoly.org/) summer school at INSA in Lyon, and
  cosupervised all other student activities.

### 2017-2018

In the previous three school years I taught laboratory classes in the computer
science track of the engineering cycle at Ã‰cole polytechnique, typically in
weekly two-hour sessions for two separate groups.

* [Computational logic (INF551)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF551-2017)
  Artificial intelligence in mathematical reasoning.

### 2016-2017

* [Concurrent and distributed programming (INF431)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF431-2016)
* [Parallel programming and big data (INF442)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF442-2016).
  For this class I also proposed and supervised student projects to analyze
  real-time data from the public transportation system of the Paris metropolitan
  area.

### 2015-2016

* [Concurrent and distributed programming (INF431)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF431-2015)
* [Programming language principles (INF321)](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/info.php?name=INF321-2015).
  Here I revamped one of the five two-week projects to serve as an introduction
  to unit testing and test-driven development.
