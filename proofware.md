(Remember, [proofs are programs](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence)!)

An important part of my time is devoted to designing, writing and proving
software, as well as techniques to do all these things. The programs that I am
interested in themselves prove things about formal artifacts: other programs,
logic formulas, mathematical theorems, etc. Some of these systems, such as
proof assistants and automated theorem provers, can directly offer formal
guarantees by connecting a formalized program specification with its verified
implementation. Others, like programming languages and their compilers, can
themselves be verified and impart indirectly, by way of their specification,
certain guarantees to the programs they manipulate, such as correctness of
translation or useful security properties.

* Recently, I am giving plentiful thought to the proof assistant
  [Abella](http://abella-prover.org/): both in relatively self-contained but
  useful features and technical improvements; and in large, ongoing
  modifications to the kernel of the system.

* Many smaller projects are directly related to the declared goal of ProofCert
  of universal production, communication (i.e., reuse) and checking (i.e.,
  trust) of proof evidence. Families of proof checkers (minimalistic or not,
  correct by construction or certified), as well as foundational proof
  certificate formats, belong here.

* Last year, I commenced work on a gradually typed flavor of the Ruby
  programming language, similar in spirit to recent developments for other
  dynamic languages like TypeScript --- though incubating my dissertation
  presently keeps me from revisiting it. The original proposal was supported by
  Google Summer of Code 2016.

Some of this work is publicly available as free and open source software, while
more experimental embryonic projects patiently bid their time.
